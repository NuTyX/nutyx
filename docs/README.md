[NuTyX](http://www.nutyx.org) is a GNU/Linux distribution for multiple 
architectures inspired by the online documentation
[Linux From Scratch (LFS)](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org).

NuTyX features a custom package manager called "cards". Cards can install binary
packages, a set of related binary packages (e.g. desktop packages, such as KDE 
or Xfce), and compile source packages from "ports". The distribution is designed
for intermediate and advanced Linux users.

Contributions are welcome. If you don't know what it all about, please take the 
time to read the documentation at http://www.nutyx.org/en/build-package.html
(version franÃ§aise) http://www.nutyx.org/fr/build-package.html

It will explain you what's a collection, a git, a port, the tools around 'cards'
etc

Have fun :)
